# Website Vision and What We Are Aiming For

### Reference Website
[Wieden+Kennedy: An Independent Creative Network](https://www.wk.com/)

> We were founded as an ad agency that didn’t like advertising—a company with no guiding principle other than to make great work for inspiring clients.  
>  
> We try to be the kind of place where creatively driven people with the widest perspectives possible can come to do the best work of their lives and find ways to use the work to say something.  
>  
> For over 40 years, we’ve made work that builds brands and influences culture. From “Just Do It” to “This Is SportsCenter” to “Dilly Dilly,” we’ve used creativity to make a dent in the world across every medium and discipline.  
>  
> Most people out there have no idea who we are—but they probably know some of the things we’ve made.

### Current Photo Platform
We currently use **[SmugMug](https://www.smugmug.com/app/dashboard)** to upload and host event photos. Participants can:

- View and download their photos  
- Purchase prints or other photo products  

---

### The Vision: A New Kind of Photo Experience
Our CEO envisions a future website that goes **beyond photo hosting**—more like a **Wikipedia-style experience for photos and stories**.

After each event:
- Participants will be able to **claim their own page**  
- View and download their photos  
- Share the story behind their **brain tattoo message**

---

### Privacy and Visibility Controls
Because privacy is extremely important to our participants, each story should include **visibility options**:

- **Public** — visible to everyone  
- **Private** — visible only to the participant and admin  

Participants will authenticate using **email + one-time passcode (OTP)** to access their page.

---

### Design Direction
- Clean, **black-and-white aesthetic**, inspired by [Wieden+Kennedy](https://www.wk.com/)  
- The number of final pages is still being determined  
- Layout and content hierarchy under review  

*(Reference images omitted here for brevity but should be placed appropriately.)*

### Admin Dashboard
*(Current design shown below — for reference only.)*

Admins will manage uploads, participants, and analytics.
