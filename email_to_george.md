Subject: Proposal: Dear World (Technical Roadmap & Vision)

Hi George,

Thank you for the detailed "Vision & Reference Guide." I’ve reviewed it thoroughly, specifically the Wieden+Kennedy aesthetic and the "Wikipedia-style" narrative requirement.

Per your request, I have prepared a comprehensive proposal that strips away the jargon and focuses on **how** we will actually achieve this vision.

**Inside the attached proposal, you will find:**

1.  **The "Trap vs. Solution" Architecture:** I explain exactly how we'll secure the platform and handle bulk uploads without using confusing tech-speak.
2.  **10-Week Roadmap:** A clear, sprint-by-sprint breakdown from "Blueprint" to "Launch."
3.  **Future-Proofing:** How we are building for 1 Million users from Day 1 using a serverless "Engine" (Next.js) and "Vault" (AWS S3).
4.  **Investment & Partnership:** Transparent pricing options, including a "Full Creative Partner" tier that focuses heavily on that Wieden+Kennedy black-and-white minimalist polish.

I’ve designed this proposal as a clean, interactive web document. You can view it live here:

I am available to walk through this with you and the team whenever you're ready.

Best regards,
