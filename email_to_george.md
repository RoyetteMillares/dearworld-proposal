Hi George,

Thanks for getting back to me! I’m a huge fan of Dear World’s storytelling format and the emotional impact of your work.

I have prepared a detailed proposal outlined specifically for this project. It covers the technical architecture, migration strategy, and a cost-benefit analysis of using a custom "Performance-First" stack.

You can view the full live proposal here: https://dearworld-proposal.vercel.app/

To quickly summarize the answers to your questions:

1. Relevant Portfolio Links

Tropa PH (Community Platform): https://www.tropaph.com/
Relevance: High-traffic community features, user profiles, and dynamic content feeds.

Creator Portfolio (Visual Showcase): https://royette-for-creators.netlify.app/portfolio
Relevance: Custom masonry galleries and optimized image handling.

2. Experience with React, Firebase, & AWS S3
I have 6+ years of experience in this exact stack. My standard architecture uses Next.js (React) for SEO and performance, Firebase for fast, real-time database/auth, and AWS S3 + CloudFront for hosting terabytes of images cheaply without sacrificing load speeds.

3. Approach to Photo-Driven Platforms
My philosophy is "Image as Hero." I use Next.js native image optimization to serving the perfect size/format (WebP/AVIF) for every device. For the backend, I implement direct-to-S3 uploads, meaning users upload large files directly to storage (bypassing the server) to ensure the site never slows down, even during high-volume submission events.

4. Migration Experience
I have successfully written automated scripts to ingest data from legacy Google Drive and NAS hierarchies into structured cloud buckets, ensuring EXIF data and folder organization are preserved during the move.

5. Availability & Timeline
- Status: Available immediately for full-time work (40 hrs/week).
- Timeline: 8–10 Weeks to MVP launch.
- Rate: I have provided two options in the attached PDF, ranging from $10,000 – $13,000 (Fixed Project Cost). This includes a 30-day post-launch support period.

I’d love to discuss the proposal in more detail. Are you free for a quick clear-up call later this week?

Best regards,
